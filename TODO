TODO:
1. Support for multi-processing / multi-threading
2. Support for computing classification accuracy at each embedding dimension
3. Prediction embedded feature space / embedded label space
4. Try replacing non-smooth functions by smooth functions

Accuracy to be checked for (observations are based on experiments performed on Wiki10 datasets)
1. innerIter (=1 is giving better result)
2. outerIter (=10 is giving optimal result)
3. different initialization for labelProjMatrix (truncnorm(-n, n)/n, larger the value of n upto n=30, better the accuracy)
4. different ordering of optimization of label projection and feature projection (optimization of feature projection first giving better results)
